# Local upstream-readiness validation

Validated on 2026-10-10. No router was modified, and no commit, push or PR was created.

## Passed checks

- Node regression suite: 100 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Python regression suite: 8 passed.
- Official LuCI master ESLint configuration: no errors or warnings.
- Native POT extraction: 184 source messages, including menu, ACL and UI.
- GNU gettext template/catalogue comparison and PO checks.
- SDK-native jshn regression run: 33 passed, 0 skipped. Network and UCI inputs were isolated fixtures.
- Workflow YAML parsing and every run block checked with bash -n.
- Shell syntax and git diff --check.

## SDK package validation

- Official x86/64 SNAPSHOT SDK archive SHA256:
  60b7182a36d0542810e5564dcf9f7c2531bbbc74546ededcbc619b2939b72127
- SDK base source commit: 53ec2d05a487e6011cfa096de9211d15197c501b.
- LuCI reference commit: 36720dd716c7f7008af95c0d520edefab621adb7.
- SDK download checksum was verified. Official GitHub mirrors were used for feeds, retaining the SDK base commit.
- Main package and Chinese language package compiled successfully.
- ip-tiny and ip-full dependency variants both built; each main package depends only on its selected IP implementation.
- Unpacked the ip-tiny packages and checked executable RPC helper, configuration preservation metadata, both applicable license texts, icon attribution and absence of legacy bundled translations.
- The language package LMO matches a fresh compilation of the current PO using SDK po2lmo.

Local APKs and manifest: /tmp/device-manager-built-packages/. These are local validation builds.
The local package version uses the existing source HEAD while compiling this uncommitted working tree.
CI builds calculate the version from the checked-out source commit; upstream builds use the LuCI feed revision.

## Remaining external acceptance

Real-router installation, upgrades, reboot persistence, account enforcement, packet captures, themes and mobile UI remain to be checked using the README acceptance steps.
GitHub Actions was validated locally but has not been triggered remotely.
Stable-release SDK/IPK builds have not been rerun in this validation.
